Our goal will be to automatically identify the outliers, and to find a linear relationship (a slope and intercept, as well as an inherent noise level) that explains rest of the points:\n",

    "This is a simple inference problem. But it has two features that make it ideal for introducing a couple new concepts in modeling and inference. First, we want not only to estimate the slope and intercept of the line that best fits the data, but also to classify each point as an inlier or outlier; that is, there are a large number of latent variables of interest, enough to make importance sampling an unreliable method (absent a more involved custom proposal that does the heavy lifting). Second, several of the parameters we're estimating (the slope and intercept) are continuous and amenable to gradient-based search techniques, which will allow us to explore Gen's optimization capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "The general shape of an MCMC algorithm is as follows. We begin by sampling an intial setting of all unobserved variables; in Gen, we produce an initial _trace_ consistent with (but not necessarily _probable_ given) our observations. Then, in a long-running loop, we make small, stochastic changes to the trace; in order for the algorithm to be asymptotically correct, these stochastic updates must satisfy certain probabilistic properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common way of ensuring that the updates do satisfy those properties is to compute a _Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio_. Essentially, after proposing a change to a trace, we add an \"accept or reject\" step that stochastically decides whether to commit the update or to revert it. This is an over-simplification, but generally speaking, this step ensures we are more likely to accept changes that make our trace fit the observed data better, and to reject ones that make our current trace worse. The algorithm also tries not to go down dead ends: it is more likely to take an exploratory step into a low-probability region if it knows it can easily get back to where it came from.\n",

    "The main design choice in designing a Block Resimulation MH algorithm is how to block the choices together for resimulation. At one extreme, we could put each random choice the model makes in its own block. At the other, we could put all variables into a single block (a strategy sometimes called \"independent\" MH, and which bears a strong similarity to importance resampling, as it involves repeatedly generating completely new traces and deciding whether to keep them or not). Usually, the right thing to do is somewhere in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the regression problem, here is one possible blocking of choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block 1: `slope`, `intercept`, and `noise`.** These parameters determine the linear relationship; resimulating them is like picking a new line. We know from our importance sampling experiment above that before too long, we're bound to sample something close to the right line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocks 2 through N+1: Each `is_outlier`, in its own block.** One problem we saw with importance sampling in this problem was that it tried to sample _every_ outlier classification at once, when in reality the chances of a single sample that correctly classifies all the points are very low. Here, we can choose to resimulate each `is_outlier` choice separately, and for each one, decide whether to use the resimulated value or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Block N+2: `prob_outlier`.** Finally, we can propose a new `prob_outlier` value; in general, we can expect to accept the proposal when it is line with the current hypothesized proportion of `is_outlier` choices that are set to `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resimulating a block of variables is the simplest form of update that Gen's `metropolis_hastings` operator (or `mh` for short) supports. When supplied with a _current trace_ and a _selection_ of trace addresses to resimulate, `mh` performs the resimulation and the appropriate accept/reject check, then returns a possibly updated trace. A selection is created using the `select` method. So a single update of the scheme we proposed above would look like this:"

This is OK (see [Using probabilistic programs as proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03612)). Writing proposals that have traced internal randomness (i.e., that make traced random choices that are not directly used in the proposal) can lead to better inference, but requires the use of a more complex version of Gen's `mh` operator, which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.)"
